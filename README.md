#Project name:
Music Mixer

##Usage
The site will feature an empty pond with 4 lily pads on it, as well as a selection bar underneath the pond that has 4 frogs with instruments, a play button, and a stop button.
The user will drag these frogs to the lily pads and once a frog is dragged to a lily pad, it will stand on the lily pad and produce sound.
The stop button will stop the frogs from making noise, and the play button will resume playback.
